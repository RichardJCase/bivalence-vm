This is a document to cover the practices that must be followed when committing. 

* Common
** Essentially, make it look as if this code has only one author.
*** Reflect existing code's indentation and spacing style.
*** Reflect existing code's naming practices.
*** Reflect existing code's practices.
*** Etc.
* (Controversial) Practices and Reasoning
** No comments
Comments do not get compiled against. There is no good form of verification for comments.
 Comments lie, code does not. If you need to comment then do so with your code.
* Tested
** General
All code must work. It's understandable to have commits that don't even compile,
 but issuing a merge request on code that doesn't work in its happy path will result in a blacklisting.
** Tests
Unit tests shall be added to all code making up the standard library. These do not have to follow strict
 guidelines, but they should still be understandable.
